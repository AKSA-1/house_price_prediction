# Stock Price Prediction Using Hybrid GRU + LSTM Model

## Project Overview
This project implements a hybrid **GRU** and **LSTM** neural network model to predict stock prices based on historical data. The dataset consists of daily stock prices, and the model predicts future prices using a combination of the **GRU layer** (for fast feature extraction) and the **LSTM layer** (for sequence learning). This hybrid approach helps improve prediction accuracy while maintaining faster execution times.

### Features
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines GRU for faster feature extraction and LSTM for better sequence learning.
- **Batch Normalization and Dropout:** Applied to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
- **Early Stopping & Learning Rate Scheduling:** Implemented to prevent overfitting and optimize training.
- **Future Prediction:** The model can predict future stock prices based on the last known sequence of data.

## Installation and Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`

You can install all dependencies using the following `pip` command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

Alternatively, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` if provided:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Dataset

The model uses a CSV file (`infolimpioavanzadoTarget.csv`) containing stock price data. The dataset should include the following columns:
- **Date:** Dates for each stock record.
- **Close Price:** Closing price of the stock, which will be used as the target for predictions.

Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly. Here's a sample structure:

| Date       | Close  |
|------------|--------|
| 2021-01-01 | 150.75 |
| 2021-01-02 | 151.30 |

## Code Explanation

### Data Preprocessing

- **Loading the Dataset:** The stock data is loaded from the CSV file and sorted by date.
- **Normalization:** The `close` prices are normalized using `MinMaxScaler` to a range between 0 and 1 for faster convergence in neural networks.
- **Sequence Generation:** Time-series data is converted into sequences using the `create_sequences()` function. These sequences are used as input (X), and the next stock price in the sequence is the label (y).

### Model Architecture

The hybrid GRU + LSTM model consists of:
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** Extracts faster features from the sequences.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Used for learning long-term dependencies in the sequence data.
- **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the outputs from each layer to speed up convergence.
- **Dropout:** Adds regularization to reduce overfitting.

The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer** and **mean squared error (MSE)** as the loss function. **Early stopping** is used to halt training when the model stops improving.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock-price-prediction-gru-lstm.git
cd stock-price-prediction-gru-lstm
```

2. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Place your dataset (`infolimpioavanzadoTarget.csv`) in the same directory or update the code to point to the correct path.

3. **Run the Script:**

```bash
python stock_price_prediction.py
```

4. **Modify Parameters (Optional):**
   - You can adjust hyperparameters like `sequence_length`, `epochs`, and `batch_size` in the code to experiment with different configurations.

## Example Usage

### Training the Model

The following example demonstrates how to train the hybrid GRU + LSTM model:

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
                    callbacks=[early_stopping, reduce_lr])
```

### Predicting Future Stock Prices

To predict future prices based on the last known data points, use the `predict_future_prices()` function:

```python
# Predict future stock prices
future_prices = predict_future_prices(model, scaled_data, num_predictions=10)
print("Future Predictions:", future_prices.flatten())
```

### Visualizing Predictions

You can plot the actual vs predicted stock prices to visualize model performance:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(data['date'].iloc[train_size + seq_length:], actual_prices, color='blue', label='Actual Stock Price')
plt.plot(data['date'].iloc[train_size + seq_length:], predicted_prices, color='red', label='Predicted Stock Price')
plt.title('Stock Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the test data using various metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Sensitive to large prediction errors.
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** Indicates the proportion of variance in stock prices explained by the model.
- **Accuracy:** Calculated as `100 - Mean Absolute Error (%)` to give an intuitive sense of the model's performance.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Experiment with different sequence lengths, hidden units, and layers to further optimize performance.
- **Additional Features:** Use other features like trading volume, opening prices, and high/low prices to improve model accuracy.
- **Advanced Architectures:** Explore more advanced neural network architectures like Transformers or Attention mechanisms to enhance prediction capabilities.
